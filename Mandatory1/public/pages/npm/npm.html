        NPM (short for Node Package Manager) is both a package manager for the JavaScript programming language, and a command-line tool for Node.js. 
        As a package manager, it can manage and share open-source packages that can be integrated into a JavaScript project. As a command-line tool, 
        it allows developers to install, update and remove these packages. NPM as a package manager is in need of a file called 'package.json', this file containts 
        the name, version, description, author, and other metadata of the project. When you begin your project, first you must create the 'package.json' file in the 
        root directory of the project. This can be done manually, or by typing in the terminal: </p>

        <pre class="code-wrapper" id="npm-terminal-init">
            <code>
npm init 
            </code>
        </pre>

        <p class="white-text" id="npm-terminal-init-text">
        This command will prompt you to answer a series of questions about your project, such as the project name, version, author, 
        description, entry point, and license.</p>

        <p class="white-text">
            You can also type the following: 
        </p>

        <pre class="code-wrapper" id="npm-terminal-init-y">
            <code>
npm init -y
            </code>
        </pre>

        <p class="white-text" id="npm-terminal-init-text">
            This command will skip the previous steps and create a standardized 'package.json' file.
        </p>

        <p class="white-text">
        When a package is installed or updated, NPM will also add the package 
        to the projects 'package.json' file as a dependency. And when a package is removed, it will of course be removed from the file again. <br>
        To install, update or remove packages with NPM, you simply type 'npm install/update/remove (package-name)', for example we can install Express by typing 
        this command in the terminal: </p>

        <pre class="code-wrapper" id="npm-terminal-install">
            <code>
npm install express 
            </code>
        </pre>

        <p class="white-text">
        When you use NPM to install, update or remove packages, NPM also automatically generate a 'package-lock.json' file. This file is a record of the exact versions 
        of packages and their dependencies that were installed in your project, and it is used by npm to ensure consistent installation across different environments. </p>
