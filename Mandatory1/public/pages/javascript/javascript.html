            <p class="white-text">
                JavaScript is a programming language used primarily for creating interactive and dynamic websites. 
                It is usually executed on the client-side and can be used to create animations, manipulate HTML/CSS, 
                and interact with server-side scripts. It is one of the most widely used programming languages and has a 
                large and active developer community.

            <p class="white-text">
                Besides some primitive datatypes such as Number, String and Boolean, JavaScript also has some object data types such as Object, Array and Function
            </p>

            <h3 class="white-text">Functions and Methods</h3>
            <p class="white-text">
                In JavaScript, both functions and methods are used to define reusable blocks of code. However, there is a difference between the two.<br>
                A function is a block of code that can be called from anywhere in your code. It takes in some arguments and returns a value. 
                A function can be defined as a standalone entity that is not associated with any object.<br>
                On the other hand, a method is a function that is associated with an object. It is defined inside the object and can access 
                the object's properties and other methods. In other words, a method is a function that is specific to an object and is used to manipulate 
                that object's data.
                </p>

                <pre class="code-wrapper" id="function-code">
                    <code>
// Defining a function
function add(x, y) {
    return x + y;
}


// Calling a function
let result = add(2, 3);
console.log(result); // Output: 5


                    </code>
                </pre>
                <pre class="code-wrapper" id="method-code">
                    <code>
// Defining a method
const joke = {
    setup: 'what is the best thing about Switzerland?',
    punchline: 'i do not know, but the flag is a big plus',
    tellJoke: function() {
    console.log(setup + ' ' + punchline);
    }
};
// Calling a method
joke.tellJoke(); // Output: 'what is the best thing about 
// Switzerland? I do not know, but the flag is a big plus'
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p class="white-text" id="arrow-function-text">
                    An arrow function is a shorthand way of defining a function in JavaScript. For example, you could define the 'add' function like this: 
                </p>
                <pre class="code-wrapper" id="arrow-function-code">
                    <code>
// Defining an Arrow function
const add = (x, y) => {
    return x + y;
    }
                </code>
            </pre>
            <h3 class="white-text">Variable declaration</h3>
            <p class="white-text">
                There are three ways do declare a variable in JavaScript, 'var', 'let' and 'const'. <br>
                The original way of doing it was with the 'var' keyword, a variable declared like that can be accessed anywhere in the function or global scope in which 
                it was declared. <br>
                'let' on the other hand, can only be accessed inside the block that it was declared. And finally 'const', that like 'let' has a block scope, but additionally 
                cannot be reassigned once it is initialized. <br>
                It's a good practice to use 'const' whenever possible, and 'let' if you need the variable to be reassigned at some point. Never use 'var'...
